## ESLint

Was super annoying to setup with VS Code extension. I spent forever trying to get it working and I was getting an error along the lines of "missing import plugin from airbnb". I eventually rolled back eslint from 8 to 7 and it fixed it. Had to install `eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-config-airbnb-typescript @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-config-next eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-import-resolver-typescript`
